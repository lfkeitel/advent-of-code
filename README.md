# Advent of Code

https://adventofcode.com/

These are my solutions to Advent of Code.

## 2018

I decided to write this year's solutions in Rust. I've just started learning
so my solutions are almost guaranteed to not be idiomatic. My intention is to
make a first attempt and then clean up later as an exercise.

### Running a solution

CD into the solution directory and run cargo:

```bash
cd 2018/day01
cargo run
```
